# Current state

## Goal

Implement bounded bilingual reply classification, recommended next actions, immutable feedback, and offline evidence without adding external writes or changing existing runtimes.

## Now

Item 1 domain policy is implemented and committed by the supervisor; the next active queue item is Item 2.

## Done

- Reply policy is implemented in `packages/core/revops/domain/values/reply.py`; it contains the nine-category mapping, finite `[0, 1]` confidence validation, inclusive `0.80` threshold, `en`/`pt` language compatibility, bounded half-open evidence offsets, conservative opt-out precedence, and manual-review fallback.
- Focused contract coverage is in `tests/unit/domain/values/test_reply.py`; `pytest tests/unit/domain -q` passed (193 passed), `ruff check packages/core/revops/domain tests/unit/domain` passed, `ruff format --check packages/core/revops/domain tests/unit/domain` passed, `mypy packages/core/revops/domain` passed, and `lint-imports` kept all 4 contracts.
- The first SPEC-011 checkbox is ticked in `docs/specs/SPEC-011-reply-intelligence/tasks.md` after observed evidence. Pilot commit `a3f954c` is on the feature branch and the gate advanced to Item 2.

## Next

1. Launch the full supervisor with `MaxTurns 100` from this clean feature branch.
2. Monitor executor commits, gate progress, `.handoff/STATE.md`, and external artifact logs.
3. Stop on gate exit 0 or 2; do not bypass a human or architecture escalation.

## Gotchas

- The authoritative checkout is `C:\Dev\SISTEMA_PORTFOLIO_AI_ENG`; the OneDrive checkout is stale and must not be used.
- Set `PYTHONPATH` to `packages\\core;repo-root` before Python checks to avoid stale editable imports.
- Do not delete or reset `.handoff/.autonomous_gate_state.json`; the gate reboots its baseline when the task count changes.
- The queue uses exact required paths so the gate can reject false task completion.
- Pytest reports a non-fatal warning because the restricted sandbox cannot update `.pytest_cache`; test execution itself passed.

## Resume

```powershell
Set-Location -LiteralPath "C:\Dev\SISTEMA_PORTFOLIO_AI_ENG"
$env:PYTHONPATH = (Join-Path (Get-Location).Path 'packages\core') + ';' + (Get-Location).Path
$env:PYTHONUTF8 = '1'
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = 'utf-8'
```

## Open questions

None for the approved SPEC-011 scope. A newly discovered product or security choice must stop the queue and be brought back for deliberate design.
